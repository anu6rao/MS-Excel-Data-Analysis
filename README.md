The "Streaming Service User Analysis" project leverages Microsoft Excel to conduct an in-depth examination of user behaviour and engagement within a streaming platform. The dataset encompasses a wide array of user-centric information, including identifiers (User ID, Username), activity timestamps (Join Date, Last Login), financial details (Monthly Price, Payment Method), content interaction metrics (Watch Hours, Favourite Genre, Total Movies and Series Watched, Recommended Content Count, Average Rating Given), device usage (Active Devices, Profile Count, First Device Used), user preferences (Language Preference, Has Downloaded Content, Primary Watch Time), demographic data (Country Name, Age Group), and engagement indicators (Parental Controls, Membership Status, Loyalty Points). By systematically analysing these variables, the project aims to uncover patterns and trends in user preferences and behaviours. Such insights are instrumental in enhancing user experience through personalized content recommendations, optimizing platform features, and informing strategic business decisions to drive user retention and satisfaction.
